			<h2 class="text-4xl mb-5 opacity-65">I'm a <span>Software Developer</span></h2>
			<p>
				Since I was a <span>kid</span>, <span>computers</span> always fascinated
				me. I could spend hours exploring them, and over time, 
				that <span>curiosity</span> led me to discover the world of <span>web 
				development</span>. What started as simple experiments eventually 
				became my <span>passion</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nowadays, I've had the opportunity to work on projects ranging from an 
				<span>AI chatbot</span> for businesses to <span>mobile apps</span>, and <span>Taskies</span>, 
				a web app designed to organize notes into different folders and <span>workspaces</span>. 
				My main focus is on creating <span>efficient solutions</span> that provide a seamless <span>user experience</span>. 
				While I frequently use technologies like <span>React</span>, <span>Tailwind</span>, and <span>SQL</span>, 
				I'm always on the lookout for <span>new tools</span> to expand my skillset and elevate my projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I enjoy the most about the process is the moment when, after hours or even days of problem-solving, 
				everything finally <span>clicks</span>. I also love blending <span>simple yet attractive design</span> with solid code. 
				When I'm not coding, you can usually find me <span>playing volleyball</span>, <span>training at the gym</span>, 
				or <span>learning a new skill</span>.
